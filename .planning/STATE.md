# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** The overlay must appear on top of the active application and feel instant
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Overlay

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation & Overlay)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (awaiting human verification checkpoint)
Status: In progress -- checkpoint:human-verify pending for 01-03
Last activity: 2026-02-21 - Completed Phase 1 Plan 3 Task 1 (hotkey config dialog); paused at human-verify checkpoint

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 0.4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-overlay | 3 | 22 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 11 min (01-01), 8 min (01-02), 3 min (01-03)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tauri over Electron: Lighter weight, smaller binary, less RAM
- xAI only for v1: Simplify scope, add other providers later
- macOS only for v1: Focus on one platform, nail the overlay UX
- Zero shell setup: Lower adoption friction, use Accessibility API + AppleScript instead
- tauri_panel! macro for NSPanel config: tauri-nspanel v2.1 uses macro-based panel config (removed setter methods)
- PanelLevel::Status (25) for window level: Chosen to float above fullscreen apps and all normal windows
- NSPanel FullScreenAuxiliary+CanJoinAllSpaces: Required collection behavior for overlay on fullscreen apps
- time crate pinned to 0.3.36: rustc 1.85.0 compatibility (0.3.47 requires 1.88.0)
- Animation phase state machine (entering/visible/exiting/hidden): Keeps overlay mounted during exit animation so overlay-out keyframe plays before unmount
- useKeyboard hook centralizes Escape + event listeners: Invoked once in App.tsx, keeps components clean
- submit() always sets showApiWarning in Phase 1: No API configured yet; Phase 4 replaces with actual AI call
- useRef for key tracking in HotkeyRecorder: avoids stale closures and excess re-renders vs useState
- invoke<string | null> return type for register_hotkey: Rust Result<(), String> maps null=success, string=error

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ - ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 1 Plan 1 COMPLETE: NSPanel integration resolved -- overlay floats above fullscreen apps using Status level + FullScreenAuxiliary
- Phase 1 Plan 2 COMPLETE: React overlay UI complete -- 640px frosted glass panel with animation, auto-focus textarea, keyboard handling, click-outside dismiss
- Phase 1 Plan 3 CHECKPOINT: Hotkey config dialog complete; awaiting human verification of full Phase 1 overlay experience (17 verification steps)
- Phase 2: Accessibility permission must be granted before terminal context reading works
- Phase 3: Terminal context reading is highest-risk technical component (requires custom FFI)
- Phase 5: AppleScript command injection must be solved before any terminal pasting

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-21 (Phase 1 Plan 3 execution)
Stopped at: Task 2 checkpoint:human-verify in 01-03-PLAN.md (run pnpm tauri dev and verify 17 steps)
Resume file: None
